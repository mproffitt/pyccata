The size of a unit is equivelant to the smallest cohesive section of code which can be executed without
changing the overall structure system in a manner which breaks subsequent tests.

Elements from within the unit which rely on external attributes, not subject to the test, must be mocked
away. These may constitute configurations, databases, third party services, and classes, modules or libraries
which support the unit either through providing data to the unit or providing access to storage or services
whose code we do not care about as part of the situation under test. (Black box testing)

For each path through the code there must exist a minimum of two tests. One which tests the "happy path" scenarios
and another which tests the unhappy path (or failure) scenarios. If your unit contains multiple failure points,
these must be tested seperately, one for each failure.
